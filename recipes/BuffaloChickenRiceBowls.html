    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 tbsp chili powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp pepper</li>
        <li>3 cups cooked rice</li>
        <li>2 medium zucchini</li>
        <li>8 oz mushrooms</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cheddar cheese shredded</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>4 tbsp buffalo sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <h2>For the Rice</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook enough rice to yield 3 cups of cooked rice. 1 cup of dry rice will make around 2-3 cups of cooked rice depending on what kind you use.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>For the Chicken</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl add the chicken, a bit of oil, chili powder, salt, and pepper, Toss to coat.</li>
        <li>You can cook your chicken however you like. I baked mine at 425 degrees F for 10 minutes and then broiled it on the top rack for 5 minutes to develop color. Cut into 1 inch pieces. If you would rather pan fry it follow the instructions in the next step.</li>
        <li>Heat a grill pan or a skillet over medium high heat and add some oil. Cook the chicken thighs for 4-5 minutes on each side. Cut them into a large dice and return to the pan to develop color.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>For the Vegetables</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and cut your zucchini into a small dice and mushrooms into a large dice. Cut the onion into a small dice.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add oil and saute the onions for a couple of minutes</li>
        <li>Add a bit more oil and add in the mushrooms, season with salt to help bring out the water. Allow them to cook and develop color.</li>
        <li>Add in the zuchinni and cook until soft</li>
        <li>Measure out 3 cups of cooked rice and add to a large bowl. Mix in the chicken, vegetables, cheese, and buffalo sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
